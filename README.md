# Example HTTP server in Rust

This repository serves as a learning project for me to explore web API development in Rust, coming from a full-stack background in Java, C#, Typescript and Python. I strive to employ best-practices of API development and clean architecture, while also getting to know various Rust libraries and idioms.

At the time of writing, the server provides endpoints for creating and retrieving users.

## Running

To start the server, run this command:
```
cargo run
```

If you want to use hot-reloading for a better development workflow, run the `watch.sh` script.
